Speech Recognition
==================
A class providing access to Microsoft's SAPI. Requires the SAPI SDK.

Reference
---------
### Recognizer := new SpeechRecognizer

Creates a new speech recognizer instance.

The instance starts off listening to any phrases.

### Recognizer.Recognize(Values = True)

Set the values that can be recognized by the recognizer.

If `Values` is an array of strings, the array is interpreted as a list of possibile phrases to recognize. Phrases not in the array will not be recognized. This provides a relatively high degree of recognition accuracy compared to dictation mode.

If `Values` is otherwise truthy, dictation mode is enabled, which means that the speech recognizer will attempt to recognize any phrases spoken.

If `Values` is falsy, the speech recognizer will be disabled and will stop listening if currently doing so.

Returns the speech recognizer instance.

### Recognizer.Listen(State = True)

Set the state of the recognizer.

If `State` is truthy, then the recognizer will start listening if not already doing so.

If `State` is falsy, then the recognizer will stop listening if currently doing so.

Returns the speech recognizer instance.

### Text := Recognizer.Prompt(Timeout = -1)

Obtains the next phrase spoken as plain text.

If `Timeout` is a positive number, the function will stop and return a blank string after this amount of time, if the user has not said anything in this interval.

If `Timeout` is a negative number, the function will wait indefinitely for the user to speak a phrase.

Returns the text spoken.

### Recognizer.OnRecognize(Text)

A callback invoked immediately upon any phrases being recognized.

The `Text` parameter received the phrase spoken.

This function is meant to be overridden in subclasses. By default, it does nothing.

The return value is discarded.

/* Example: recognizing a specific list of phrases
TrayTip, Speech Recognition, Say a number between 0 and 9 inclusive

s := new SpeechRecognizer
s.Recognize(["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"])
Text := s.Prompt()

TrayTip, Speech Recognition, You said: %Text%

s := new SpeechRecognizer
