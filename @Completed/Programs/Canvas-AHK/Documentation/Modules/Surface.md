Surfaces
--------
Surfaces represent and allow the manipulation of graphics properties and data. This may include drawing, painting, and more.

Surfaces are implemented in the Canvas.Surface class.

### Canvas.Surface.__New(Width = 1,Height = 1)
Creates a surface object representing a set of graphics properties and data, having a width of `Width` (units) and height `Height` (units).

Returns the new surface object.

### Canvas.Surface.Interpolation := "None"
Represents the current interpolation mode of the surface (interpolation style). Interpolation modes define the appearance of surfaces when scaled.

Interpolation styles are one of the following values:

| Style  | Effect                                                                                                         |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None   | Pixels are sampled according to the nearest neighbor. Suitable for fast, low quality, or pixelated effects.    |
| Linear | Pixels are linearly sampled across the source values. Suitable for medium quality and reasonably fast effects. |
| Cubic  | Pixels are sampled according to a cubic spline. Suitable for high quality, slower effects.                     |

### Canvas.Surface.Smooth := "None"
Represents the current smooth mode of the surface (smooth style). Smooth modes define the appearance and antialiasing of objects drawn onto the surface.

Smooth styles are one of the following values:

| Style | Effect                                                                                          |
|:------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None  | Objects are not smoothed or antialiased. Suitable for fast, low quality, or pixelated effects.  |
| Good  | Objects are smoothed and antialiased at medium quality. Suitable for reasonably fast effects.   |
| Best  | Objects are smoothed and antialiased at high quality. Suitable for slower but smoother effects. |

### Canvas.Surface.Compositing := "Blend"
Represents the current compositing mode of the surface (compositing style). Compositing styles define how objects drawn onto the surface interact with existing data on the surface.

| Style     | Effect                                                                                              |
|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blend     | Objects are blended with the data already on the surface, calculated using individual alpha values. |
| Overwrite | Objects are directly drawn onto the surface, without regard for what is already there.              |

Otherwise, the curve is open. The curve's bend flexibility is denoted by `Tension` (0 to 1 inclusive), where 0 results in straight lines between points and 1 results in a Catmull-Rom/neutral spline. Tension is proportional to the length of each tangent.
