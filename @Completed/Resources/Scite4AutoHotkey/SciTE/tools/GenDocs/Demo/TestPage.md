## Something
You might want to DIE. In order to **do** so (or **no\*\*t**) use `SomeClass.Func()`:
> o := new SomeClass() ; This might want to DIEDIEDIE
> o.Func()
> ; This is a separate line
> o := "" ; This line is not needed
> MsgBox What; is this
> try
> {
>     oSC := ComObjCreate("ScriptControl")
>     
>     oSC := ""
> }
Else you *cannot* DIE.

* Toast
