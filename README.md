AHK-Scripts
===========

A whole bunch of AutoHotkey scripts from around 2009-2013, including archives from several now long-defunct websites and forum posts. Most of them actually still run!

AutoHotkey is how I learned to program. The main thing I remember is the extremely friendly and welcoming community. It's a special place to me, particularly due to regulars such as `tidbit`, `Bugz000`, and `infogulch`.

It's been nearly a decade now since I've used Windows full-time. Half of the scripts in this collection are incomplete, but I might as well publish this for historical and nostalgic purposes. Link rot seems to have taken a lot of interesting things offline, so hopefully this helps people looking for that!

Also, if you were a part of the community in the 2009-2013 era, I'd be happy to hear from you if you say hi at me@anthonyz.ca :)

Highlights
----------

* [Lots of saved scripts, libraries, and collections from the AutoHotKey forums](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Saved)
    * In particular, [a full archive of AutoHotKey.net from ~10 years ago](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Saved/AHK.net%20Archive)
    * Some programs that are hard to find elsewhere, such as this [AutoHotkey decompiler](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Programs/Decompiler) (actually, it just extracts the source code out of the packed executable!)
* [A custom platformer game with flexible game engine, music, and loadable levels](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Programs/ProgressPlatformer).
    * I later tried to abstract the entity framework in this game into its own [separate game engine](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/Sundance).
* [A 2D physics engine with constraints and springs](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/Parasol)
* [A 2D graphics library using GDI+](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Programs/Canvas-AHK).
* [A programming language called Autonomy](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/Compiler) (interestingly, it also had its own bytecode format and a peephole optimizer! an extremely valuable learning experience)
* [A unit test framework made together with the irreplaceable `infogulch`](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/Yunit)
* [A database library supporting SQLite3](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Programs/AHK%20DB).
* [A circuit designer for Minetest, a Minecraft-like video game](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Programs/MeseconEdit) (specifically, Mesecons, a Minetest mod, for which I added support for a zero-tick NOT gate).
* [A parallel processing library, which I'd now describe as "Python's multiprocessing but for AHK"](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/Parallelist).
* [A static site generator](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Programs/Website). I didn't know it was called that at the time!
* [A Fisher classifier library](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/%40Completed/Functions%20And%20Scriptlets/Classifier)
* [The one script I had that actually uses AHK for its intended purpose, hotkeys](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/%40Completed/FixKeys.ahk)
* [A webserver built on top of Winsock](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/Basic%20Webserver).
* [An IRC library](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/IRC.ahk) (I remember there was a bot built on top of this too, but can't find it anymore)
* [A minifier that... operations almost entirely through regular expressions!](https://github.com/Uberi/AHK-Scripts/blob/master/Minifier.ahk)
