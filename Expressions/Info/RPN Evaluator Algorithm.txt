While there are input tokens left
	Read the next token from input.
	If the token is a value:
		Push it onto the stack.
	Otherwise, the token is an operator (operator here includes both operators, and functions):
		It is known beforehand that the operator takes n arguments.
		If there are fewer than n values on the stack:
			(Error) The user has not input sufficient values in the expression.
		Pop the top n values from the stack.
		Evaluate the operator, with the values as arguments.
		Push the returned results, if any, back onto the stack.
