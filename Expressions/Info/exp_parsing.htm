<h1 align="center">Parsing Expressions by Recursive Descent</h1>

<p align="center">Theodore Norvell (C) 1999-2001 </p>

<p>Parsing expressions by recursive descent poses two classic problems 

</p><ol>
  <li>how to get the abstract syntax tree to follow the precedence and associativity of
    operators and</li>
  <li>how to do so efficiently when there are many levels of precedence.</li>
</ol>

<p>The classic solution to the first problem does not solve the second. I will present the
classic solution, a well known alternative known as the "Shunting Yard
Algorithm", and a less well known one that I have called "Precedence
Climbing". &nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="grammar" id="grammar"></a>An example grammar for expressions</h2>

<p>Consider the following example grammar, <em>G</em>, </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E --&gt; E "+" E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | E "-" E
        | "-" E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | E "*" E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | E "/" E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | E "^" E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | "(" E ")"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | v</pre>

<p>in which&nbsp; v&nbsp; is a terminal representing identifiers and/or constants. </p>

<p>We want to build a parser that will 

</p><ol>
  <li>Produce an error message if its input is not in the language of this grammar.</li>
  <li>Produce an "abstract syntax tree" (AST) reflecting the structure of the input,
    if the input is in the language of the grammar.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each  input in the language will have a single AST based on the following precedence and
associativity rules: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Parentheses have precedence over all operators.</li>
  <li>^ (exponentiation) has precedence over /, *, -, and +.</li>
  <li>* and / have precedence over unary - and binary - and +.</li>
  <li>Unary - has precedence over binary - and +.</li>
  <li>^ is right associative while all other operators are left associative.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example the first three rules tell us that </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a ^ b * c ^ d + e ^ f / g ^ (h + i)</pre>

<p>parses to the tree </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +( *( ^(a,b), ^(c,d) ), /( ^(e,f), ^(g,+(h,i)) ) )</pre>

<p>while the last rule tells us that </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a - b - c</pre>

<p>parses to <tt>-(-(a,b),c)</tt> rather than <tt>-(a,-(b,c))</tt>, whereas </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a ^ b ^ c</pre>

<p>parses to<tt> ^(a, ^(b,c))</tt> rather than <tt>^(^(a,b), c)</tt>. </p>
<p>The precedence of unary - over ^ tells us that </p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a ^ - b</pre>
<p>parses to -( ^( a, -(b) ) ). Some programming language designers choose to put unary operators at the highest level of precedence. I took a different choice here because having some binary operators with higher precedence than some unary operators makes the parsing problem just a bit more challenging.</p>
<p><em>Aside: I am assuming that the desired output of the parser is an abstract syntax
tree (AST). The same considerations arise if the output is to be some other form such as
reverse-polish notation (RPN), calls to an analyzer and code generator (for one-pass
compilers), or a numerical result (as in a calculator). All the algorithms I present are
easily modified for these forms of output.</em></p>

<h2><a name="RDP"></a>Recursive-descent recognition </h2>

<p>The idea of recursive-descent parsing is to transform each nonterminal of a grammar
into a subroutine that will recognize exactly that nonterminal in the input. </p>

<p>Left recursive grammars, such as <em>G</em>, are unsuitable because a left-recursive production
leads to an infinite recursion in the recursive-descent parser. While the parser may be
partially correct, it may not terminate. </p>

<p>We can transform <em>G</em> to a non-left-recursive grammar <em>G</em>1 as follows: </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E --&gt; P {B P}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P --&gt; v | "(" E ")" | U P
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B --&gt; "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "^"
    U --&gt; "-"</pre>

<p>The braces "{" and "}" represent zero or more repetitions of what
is inside of them. Thus you can think of E as having an infinity of alternatives:</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E --&gt; P | P B P | P B P B P | ... ad infinitum</pre>

<p>The language described by this grammar is the same as that of grammar <em>G</em>: <em>L(G</em>1<em>) =
L(G)</em>.</p>

<p>Not only is left recursion eliminated, but the <em>G</em>1 is unambiguous and each choice can be made by looking at the
next token in the input.</p>
<p><em>Aside: Technically, G</em>1<em> is an example of what is called an LL</em>(1)<em> grammar. I don't want to make this essay more technical than it needs to be, so I'm not going to stop and go into what that means. End of Aside.</em></p>
<p>Let's look at a <em>recursive descent recognizer</em> based on this grammar. I call
this algorithm a recognizer because all it does is to recognize whether the input is in
the language of the grammar or not. That is&nbsp; it does not produce an abstract syntax
tree, or any other form of output that represents the contents of the input.</p>

<p>I'll assume that the following subroutines exist:

</p><ul>
  <li>"next" returns the next token of input or special marker "end" to
    represent that there are no more input tokens. "next" does not alter the input
    stream.</li>
  <li>"consume" reads one token. When "next=end", consume is still
    allowed, but has no effect.</li>
  <li>"error" stops the parsing process and reports an error.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these, let's construct a subroutine "Expect", which I will use
throughout this essay</p>

<pre><u>expect</u>( <u>tok</u> ) <strong>is</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>if</strong> next = tok 
       consume
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>else</strong>
       error</pre>

<p>We will now write a subroutine called "Erecognizer". If it does not call
"error", then the input was an expression according to the above grammars. If it
does call "error", then the input contained a syntax error, e.g. unmatched
parentheses, a missing operator or operand, etc.</p>

<pre><u>Erecognizer</u> <strong>is</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp; E()
&nbsp;&nbsp; expect( end )</pre>

<pre><u>E</u> <strong>is</strong>
    P
    <strong>while</strong> next is a binary operator
       consume
       P</pre>

<pre><u>P</u> <strong>is</strong>
    <strong>if</strong> next is a v
         consume
    <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next = "("
         consume
         E
         expect( ")" )
    <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next is a unary operator
         consume
         P
    <strong>else</strong>
         error</pre>

<p>Notice how the structure of the recognition algorithm mirrors the structure of the
grammar. This is the essence of recursive descent parsing.</p>

<p>The difference between a recognizer and a parser is that a parser produces some kind of
output that reflects the structure of the input. Next we will look at a way to modify the
above recognition algorithm to be a parsing algorithm. It will build an AST, according to
the precedence and associativity rules, using a method known as the "shunting
yard" algorithm.</p>

<h2><a name="shunting_yard" id="shunting_yard"></a>The shunting yard algorithm</h2>

<p>The idea of the shunting yard algorithm is to keep operators on a stack until we are
sure we have parsed both their operands. The operands are kept on a second stack. The
shunting yard algorithm can be used to directly evaluate expressions as they are parsed
(it is commonly used in electronic calculators for this task), to create a reverse Polish
notation translation of an infix expression, or to create an abstract syntax tree. I'll
create an abstract syntax tree, so my operand stacks will contain trees.</p>

<p>The key to the algorithm is to keep the operators on the operator stack ordered by precedence (lowest at bottom and highest at top), at least in the absence of parentheses. Before pushing an operator onto the operator stack, all higher precedence operators are cleared from the stack. Clearing an operator consists of removing the operator from the operator stack and its operand(s) from the operand stack, making a new tree, and pushing that tree onto the operand stack. At the end of an expression the
remaining operators are put into trees with their operands and that is that.</p>
<p>The following table illustrates the process for an input of x*y+z. Stacks are written with their tops to the left. The sentinel value acts as an operator of lowest precedence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to "next", "consume". "end",
"error", and "expect", which are explained in the previous section, I
will assume that the following subroutines and constants exist: 

</p><ul>
  <li>"binary" converts a token matched by B to an operator.</li>
  <li>"unary" converts a token matched by U to an operator. We require that
    functions "unary" and "binary" have disjoint ranges.</li>
  <li>"mkLeaf" converts a token matched by v to a tree.</li>
  <li>"mkNode" takes an operator and one or two trees and returns a tree.</li>
  <li>"push", "pop", "top": the usual stack operations.</li>
  <li>"empty": an empty stack</li>
  <li>"sentinel" is a value that is not in the range of either unary or binary.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the algorithm that follows I compare operators and the sentinel with a &gt; sign.
This comparison is defined as follows: 

</p><ul>
  <li>binary(x) &gt; binary(y), if x has higher precedence than y, or x is left associative
    and x and y have equal precedence.</li>
  <li>unary(x) &gt; binary(y), if x has precedence higher or equal to y's</li>
  <li>op &gt; unary(y), never (where op is any unary or binary operator)</li>
  <li>sentinel &gt; op, never (where op is any unary or binary operator)</li>
  <li>op &gt; sentinel&nbsp; (where op is any unary or binary operator): This case doesn't
    arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we define the following subroutines:</p>

<p><em>Aside: I hope the pseudo-code notation is fairly clear.&nbsp; I'll just comment
that I'm assuming that parameters are passed by reference, so only 2 stacks are created
throughout the execution of EParser.</em></p>

<pre><u>Eparser</u> <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>var</strong> <u>operators</u> : Stack of Operator := empty
   <strong>var</strong> <u>operands</u> : Stack of Tree := empty
   push( operators, sentinel )
&nbsp;&nbsp; E( operators, operands )
&nbsp;&nbsp; expect( end )
   <strong>return</strong> top( operands )</pre>

<pre><u>E</u>( <u>operators</u>, <u>operands</u> ) <strong>is</strong>
    P( operators, operands )
    <strong>while</strong> next is a binary operator
       pushOperator( binary(next), operators, operands )
       consume
       P( operators, operands )
    <strong>while</strong> top(operators) <strong>not</strong>= sentinel
       popOperator( operators, operands )</pre>

<pre><u>P</u>( <u>operators</u>, <u>operands</u> ) <strong>is</strong>
    <strong>if</strong> next is a v
         push( operands, mkLeaf( v ) )
         consume
    <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next = "("
         consume
         push( operators, sentinel )
         E( operators, operands )
         expect( ")" )
         pop( operators )
    <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next is a unary operator
         pushOperator( unary(next), operators, operands )
         consume
         P( operators, operands )
    <strong>else</strong>
         error</pre>

<pre><u>popOperator</u>( <u>operators</u>, <u>operands</u> ) <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>if</strong> top(operators) is binary
        <strong>const</strong> <u>t1</u> := pop( operands )
        <strong>const</strong> <u>t0</u> := pop( operands )
        push( operands, mkNode( pop(operators), t0, t1 ) )
   <strong>else</strong>
        push( operands, mkNode( pop(operators), pop(operands) ) )</pre>

<pre><u>pushOperator</u>( <u>op</u>, <u>operators</u>, <u>operands</u> ) <strong>is</strong>
    <strong>while</strong> top(operators) &gt; op
       popOperator( operators, operands )
    push( op, operators )</pre>

<h2><a name="classic"></a>The classic solution</h2>

<p>The classic solution to recursive-descent parsing of expressions is to create a new
nonterminal for each level of precedence as follows. <em>G</em>2: </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E --&gt; T {( "+" | "-" ) T}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T --&gt; F {( "*" | "/" ) F}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F --&gt; P ["^" F]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P --&gt; v | "(" E ")" | "-" T</pre>

<p>(The brackets [ and ] enclose an optional part of the production. As before, the braces
{ and } enclose parts of the productions that may be repeated 0 or more times, and | separates alternatives. The
unquoted parentheses ( and ) serve only to group elements in a production.)</p>

<p>Grammar <em>G</em>2 describes the same language as the previous two grammars: <em>L(G</em>2<em>) = L(G</em>1<em>)
= L(G)</em> </p>

<p>The grammar is ambiguous; for example, -x*y has two parse trees. The ambiguity is
resolved by staying in each loop (in the productions for E and T) as long as possible and
by taking the option if possible (in the production for F). With that policy in place, all
choices can be made by looking only at the next token of input. </p>

<p>Note that the left-associative and the right-associative operators are treated
differently; left-associative operators are consumed in a loop, while right-associative
operators are handled with right-recursive productions. This is to make the tree building
a bit easier.</p>
<p>Here is an example of parsing a*b - c^d - e*f </p>
<p><img src="./exp_parsing_files/exp_parsing-0.png" width="576" height="347"></p>
<p>Each contour line shows what is recognized by each invocation of E, T, or F. For instance we can see that the top level call to E makes invokes T three times; these three invocations of T respectively recognize a*b, c^d, and e*f. Not shown are the calls to P, of which there is one for each variable.</p>
<p>We can transform this grammar to a parser written in pseudo code.</p>

<pre><u>Eparser</u> <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>var</strong> <u>t</u> : Tree
&nbsp;&nbsp; t := E
&nbsp;&nbsp; expect( end )
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>return</strong> t</pre>

<pre><u>E</u> <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>var</strong> <u>t</u> : Tree
&nbsp;&nbsp; t := T
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>while</strong> next = "+" <strong>or</strong> next = "-"
&nbsp;&nbsp;    <strong>const</strong> <u>op</u> := binary(next)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>const</strong> <u>t1</u> := T
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t := mkNode( op, t, t1 )
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>return</strong> t</pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>return</strong> t</pre>

<pre><u>F</u> <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>var</strong> t : Tree
   t := P
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>if</strong> next = "^"
&nbsp;&nbsp;      consume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <strong>const </strong><u>t1</u> := F
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <strong>return</strong> mkNode( binary("^"), t, t1)
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>else</strong>
        <strong>return</strong> t</pre>

<pre><u>P</u> <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>var</strong> <u>t</u> : Tree
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>if</strong> next is a v
&nbsp;&nbsp;      t := mkLeaf( next )
&nbsp;&nbsp;      consume
&nbsp;&nbsp;      <strong>return</strong> t
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>else </strong><strong>if</strong> next = "("
&nbsp;&nbsp;      consume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t := E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expect( ")" )
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>return</strong> t&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next = "-"
        consume
        t := F
        <strong>return</strong> mkNode( unary("-"), t)
   <strong>else</strong> 
        error</pre>

<p>It may be worthwhile to trace this algorithm on a few example inputs. </p>

<p>Although this is the classic solution, it has a few drawbacks: 

</p><ul>
  <li>The size of the code is proportional to the number of precedence levels.</li>
  <li>The speed of the algorithm is proportional to the number of precedence levels.</li>
  <li>The number of precedence levels is built in.</li>
</ul>

<p>When there are a large number of precedence levels, as in the C and C++ languages, the
first two disadvantages become problematic. In Pascal the number of precedence levels was
deliberately kept small because —I suspect— its designer, Niklaus Wirth, was aware of the
shortcomings of this method when the number of precedence levels is large.</p>

<p>The size problem can be overcome by creating one subroutine that is parameterized by
precedence level rather than writing a separate routine for each level. But the speed
problem remains. Note that the number of calls to parse an expression consisting of a
single identifier is proportional to the number of levels of precedence.</p>

<h2><a name="climbing"></a>Precedence climbing</h2>

<p>A method that solves all the listed problems of the classic solution, while being
simpler than the shunting-yard algorithm is what I call "precedence climbing". (Note however that we will climb <em>down</em> the precedence levels.) </p>

<p>Consider the input sequence</p>

<pre>    a ^ b * c + d + e</pre>

<p>The E subroutine of the classic solution will deal with this by three calls to T, and
by consuming the 2 "+"s, building a tree</p>

<p align="center">+(+(result of first call, result of second call), result of third call)</p>

<p>We say that this loop directly consumes the two "+" operators.</p>

<p>The precedence climbing algorithm has a similar loop, but it always directly consumes
the first binary operator, then it consumes the next binary operator that is of lower
precedence, then the next operator that is of lower precedence than that. When it consumes
a left-associative operator, the same loop will also consume the next operator of equal
precedence. Let me rewrite the example with operators written at different heights
according to their precedence:</p>

<pre>             +   +
         *
     ^   
   a   b   c   d   e</pre>

<p>One loop can consume all 4 operators, creating the tree</p>

<p align="center">+(+(*(^(result of first call, result of second call) result of 3rd
call), result of 4th call), result of 5th call)</p>

<p>Each operator is assigned a precedence number. To make things more interesting lets add
a few more binary operators and use the following precedence tables: </p>

<table border="1" height="21" cellpadding="20">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td height="15" valign="top"><table border="1" width="77" cellpadding="5">
      <caption>Unary operators</caption>
      <tbody><tr>

<p>We use the following grammar <em>G</em>3 in which nonterminal Exp is parameterized by a
precedence level. The idea is that Exp(p) recognizes expressions which contain no binary
operators (other than in parentheses) with precedence less than p</p>

<pre>E --&gt; Exp(0) 
Exp(p) --&gt; P {B Exp(q)} 
P --&gt; U Exp(q) | "(" E ")" | v
B --&gt; "+" | "-"  | "*" |"/" | "^" | "||" | "&amp;&amp;" | "="
U --&gt; "-"</pre>

<p>The loop implied by the braces, { and }, in the production for Exp(p) presents a
problem: when should the loop be exited? This choice is resolved as follows: 

</p><ul>
  <li>If the next token is a binary operator and the precedence of that operator is greater or
    equal to p,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then the loop is (re)entered.</li>
  <li>Otherwise the loop is exited.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the productions for Exp(p) and P, the recursive use of Exp is parameterized, by a
value q. So there is a second choice to resolve: how is q chosen? The value of q is chosen
according to the previous operator: 

</p><ul>
  <li>In the binary operator case: <ul>
      <li>if the binary operator is left associative, q = the precedence of the operator + 1,</li>
      <li>if the binary operator is right associative,&nbsp;&nbsp;q = the precedence of the
        operator.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After unary operators,&nbsp; <ul>
      <li>q=the precedence of the operator.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Consider what will happen in parsing the expression,&nbsp; a * b - c * d - e * f
= g * h - i * j - k * l. To make things clearer, I'll present this expression 2
dimensionally to show the precedences of the operators:</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
2                       =
3           -     -           -     -
5        *     *     *     *     *     *
        a b   c d   e f   g h   i j   k l
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0  0     0     0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </pre>

<p>The call to Exp(0) will consume exactly the operators indicated by a 0 underneath. The
sub-expressions: a, b, c*d, e*f, and g*h-i*k-k*l will be parsed by calls to P and Exp(6),
Exp(4), Exp(4) and Exp(3) respectively. The whole parse is illustrated by</p>
<p><img src="./exp_parsing_files/exp_parsing-1.png" width="910" height="394"> </p>
<p>In this picture, each call to Exp is indicated by a dashed contour. The number immediately inside the contour indicates the value of the p parameter. Not shown are the calls to P, of which there is one for each variable, in this example.</p>
<p>What about right-associative operators? Consider an expression </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a^b^c</pre>

<p>Because of the different way right-associative operators are treated, Exp(0) will only
consume the first ^, as the second will be gobbled up by a recursive call to Exp(6). </p>
<p><img src="./exp_parsing_files/exp_parsing-2.png" width="413" height="289"></p>
<p>A recursive-descent parser based on this method looks  like this:</p>

<pre><u>Eparser</u> <strong>is</strong>
   <strong>var</strong> <u>t</u> : Tree
&nbsp;&nbsp; t := Exp( 0 )
&nbsp;&nbsp; expect( end )
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>return</strong> t</pre>

<pre><u>Exp</u>( <u>p</u> ) <strong>is</strong>
    <strong>var</strong> <u>t</u> : Tree
    t := P
    <strong>while</strong> next is a binary operator <strong>and</strong> prec(binary(next)) &gt;= p
       <strong>const </strong><u>op</u> := binary(next)
       consume
       <strong>const</strong> <u>q</u> := <strong>case</strong> associativity(op)
                  <strong>of</strong> Right: prec( op )
                     Left:  1+prec( op )
       <strong>const</strong> <u>t1</u> := Exp( q )
       t := mkNode( op, t, t1)
    <strong>return</strong> t</pre>

<pre><u>P</u> <strong>is</strong>
    <strong>if</strong> next is a unary operator
         <strong>const </strong><u>op</u> := unary(next)
         consume
         q := prec( op )
         <strong>const </strong><u>t</u> := Exp( q )
         <strong>return</strong> mkNode( op, t )
    <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next = "("
         consume
         <strong>const</strong> <u>t</u> := Exp( 0 )
         expect ")"
         <strong>return</strong> t
    <strong>else</strong> <strong>if</strong> next is a v
         <strong>const</strong> <u>t</u> := mkLeaf( next )
         consume
         <strong>return</strong> t<strong>
    else</strong>
         error</pre>

<h3>Implementations</h3>
<p>I've used precedence climbing in a JavaCC parser for a subset of C++. I've also
  used it in a parser based on monadic parsing written in Haskell. I'd be happy to mail
  either grammar to anyone who is interested. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.engr.mun.ca/~mpbl">Michael Bruce-Lockhart</a> has implemented a table driven version of the precedence climbing 
algorithm. Download it here <a href="http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/parser.js">parser.js</a> and <a href="http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/parserTest.htm">parserTest.htm</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="bib"></a>Bibliographic Notes </h2>
<p>I'm not sure who invented what I am calling the classic algorithm. (Anyone know?) Certainly it was made popular by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a> who used it in various compilers, notably for Pascal. I learned it from one of Wirth's books. </p>
<p>The Shunting Yard Algorithm was invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger Dijkstra</a> around 1960 in connection with one of the first Algol compilers. It is described in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/MCReps/MR35.PDF">a Mathematisch Centrum report </a> (starting around page 21). I think I first saw a version of it described in an ad for the TI-58/59 calculators, two of the earlier calculators to handle precedence.</p>
<p>I first saw what I've called the precedence climbing method described by <a href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~keithc/">Keith Clarke</a> in a <a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/92-05-140">posting to comp.compilers
  in 1992</a>. It is closely related to the <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/512927.512931">Top Down Operator Precedence</a> method proposed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Pratt">Vaughn Pratt</a> in 1972.</p>
