# Useful tools: TillaGoTo

## TillaGoTo
[TillaGoTo](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=41575) is a script written by [TheGood](http://www.autohotkey.net/~TheGood/).
You can use it with Scintilla-based editors, such as Notepad++, Scite, Scite4AutoHotkey, Notepad2 and others.

When pressing a custom hotkey while editing a script, a small window will appear with a list of all labels, hotkeys and functions you defined in your script.
Choose one, click it and you're automatically scrolled to that label or function. This is especially helpful when your code is very long.

There are a lot of customization options, more or less advanced. To change those, just edit the top section of the script.

**Note:** TillaGoTo is already integrated in Scite4AutoHotkey.

## Alternatives
You want might checkout [ActiveGoTo](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11998) for editors not based on Scintilla.
