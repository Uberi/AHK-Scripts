# A guide to the manual

## Where to find the AutoHotkey help file?
AutoHotkey comes with a ***great*** help file that explains a lot of things. This comes with the installer and is usually located at `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.chm`. There's also an online version at [www.autohotkey.com/docs/](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/).

For AutoHotkey\_L, the online version is at [www.autohotkey.net/~Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L](http://l.autohotkey.net/docs/).

For German, there's a complete translation of the AutoHotkey\_L manual available [in the german forum](http://de.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8861).

Some (incomplete) IronAHK docs are [here](http://www.ironahk.net/docs/). For most undocumented cases, you can use the AutoHotkey classic helpfile.

There are no helpfiles for AutoHotkey v2  and AutoHotkey\_H v2 right now. Users should check out the [Autohotkey v2 thread](http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=70266) for changes.

AutoHotkey\_H docs are also available online at [autohotkey.net](http://www.autohotkey.net/~HotKeyIt/AutoHotkey/).

## How to use the help file
Running the above file gives you the usual WindowsHelp window. You can navigate to the right using the `content` tree, entering keywords in the `index` or the `search` tab, and save the most used pages in the `Favorites` tab.

When you have a problem, try searching with different keywords. Also check out the FAQ page.

A typical help page has on the top the name of the command, directive or function it is about, followed by a short summary. In the yellow box, there's a description of the syntax to use.

### Note:
 
If parameters are enclosed in square brackets ("\[" and "\]"), this **does not mean you have to copy the brackets.** Instead it means the parameters inside the brackets are *optional* and can be left out.

After the syntax, there's a table describing the parameters and what to use for them. More information on the command's / function's / directive's behaviour can be found below.

Also common is a list of related stuff that helps you if the current page is not what you're looking for.

Last but not least, there are examples almost everywhere. Remember to read the comments, as they sometimes contain instructions how to use the sample.

Also very useful is the [alphabetical list of commands, functions and directives](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands.htm) ([AutoHotkey\_L](http://l.autohotkey.net/docs/commands/), [IronAHK](http://www.ironahk.net/docs/commands/)).
