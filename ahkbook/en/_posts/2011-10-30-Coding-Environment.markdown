# The coding environment
There's no full-blown **IDE** (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvirontment) for AutoHotkey yet. But there are some tools and projects that are presented on this page.

## GuiCreator
There are several scripts in the forum called ["Basic GuiCreator"](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71992), ["SmartGui"](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=775), ["SmartGui+"](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=67138), ["LilBuilder"](www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=20097), ...
Those scripts let you create GUIs (AutoHotkey windows) by dragging and positioning controls (**W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et) and output AutoHotkey code.
One of them is also integrated with Scite4AutoHotkey.
