# First steps

## What's here?
We'll finally do our first script now. It won't be a big deal, just one line of code, but it will show you the general process of writing a script, and some mistakes you should avoid.

After we wrote the script, we'll be able to compile it. You'll also learn a few theoretics on compiling.

1. [Your first script](Your-First-Script.html)
2. [Compiling your script](Compiling.html)
