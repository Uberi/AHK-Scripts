# Useful tools: AutoHotkey editors

## Useful tools
Throughout this book, we will have a short look at some useful tools & scripts for developing AutoHotkey.
This might not interest you now if you're just starting with AutoHotkey, scripting and programming.
In this case, just **skip these posts**. You might want to check them out later when writing large scripts.

## AutoHotkey editors
You can, as mentioned when writing your first script, use any editor for AutoHotkey. Windows Notepad will do the job. This is what you **need.**

However, you might not **want** to do so. You can have a lot more comfort with other editors. Some are presented here.

### Scite4AutoHotkey
The most popular editor is [Scite4AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=58820), which is almost a real full-blown [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for AutoHotkey.
It is based on Scite, but has a lot of custom additions, including of course syntax highlighting for AutoHotkey, and many tools presented in this series are already integrated.

### Notepad++
Notepad++ can highlight AutoHotkey syntax and do code folding with the plugin presented in [this forum-thread](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic58792.html).

### Notepad2
[Notepad2-mod](http://code.google.com/p/notepad2-mod/) has added syntax highlighting support for AutoHotkey (and other languages).

## IDE projects
There are several aborted and still existing IDE projects in the forums, among those [AHKIDE (aborted)](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=56454), [Ahk_Ide_v3 (aborted)](http://de.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6712), [SmartDevelop](http://de.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8957) and [ChameleonCoder + AHKModule](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=72874).
