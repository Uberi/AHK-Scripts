# Some basic things to understand
To successfully work with AutoHotkey, and with any other scripting or programming language, you should understand the basic concepts of the language. This section will discuss the concepts in AutoHotkey. They are consistent with all forks and versions, and some are also very common among other languages.

So, if you're familiar with other languages, some things here will be known to you. You can skip the section, but don't blame me if you don't understand the code later.
