gatling supports very basic .htaccess handling.

If checks (in the current directory only!) for a .htaccess file, which
is expected to have the following syntax:

  Realm
  username:password
  username2:password2
  [...]

Realm is simply a string that is usually displayed by the browser when
prompting for the password.  username is the user name in plain text,
and password is the password in crypt(3) format (like in /etc/passwd).

gatling only supports basic authentication.

You can also password protect a whole server.  Just put a
.htaccess_global file in the directory of the server, same syntax.
