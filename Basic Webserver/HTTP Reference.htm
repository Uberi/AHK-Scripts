<P>HTTP is the network protocol of the Web.  It is both simple and powerful.  
Knowing HTTP enables you to write Web browsers, Web servers, 
automatic page downloaders, link-checkers, and other useful tools.

</P><P>This tutorial explains the simple, English-based structure of HTTP 
communication, and teaches you the practical details of writing HTTP clients
and servers.  It assumes you know basic socket programming. 
HTTP is simple enough for a beginning sockets programmer, so this 
page might be a good followup to a 
<A href="http://world.std.com/~jimf/papers/sockets/sockets.html">sockets 
tutorial</A>.  This

<A href="http://www.developerweb.net/sock-faq/">Sockets FAQ</A>
(hint: see "Categorized Questions" section at bottom)
focuses on C, but the underlying concepts are language-independent.

</P><P>Since you're reading this, you probably already use CGI.
If not, it makes sense to 
<A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/cgi/">learn that first</A>.

</P><P>The whole tutorial is about 15 printed pages long, including
examples. The first half explains basic HTTP&nbsp;1.0, and the second
half explains the new requirements and features of HTTP&nbsp;1.1. This
tutorial doesn't cover everything about HTTP; it explains the basic
framework, how to comply with the requirements, and where to find out
more when you need it.  If you plan to use HTTP extensively, you
should read <A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#httpspec">the specification</A> as well-- see the
end of this document for more details.

</P><P>Before getting started, understand the following two 
paragraphs:

</P><P><TT>&lt;LECTURE&gt;</TT>
</P><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><I>Writing HTTP or other network programs requires more care
than programming for a single machine.</I></B>  Of course, you have to 
follow standards, or no one will understand you.  But even more important
is the burden you place on other machines.  Write a bad program for
your own machine, and you waste your own resources (CPU time, bandwidth,
memory).  Write a bad network program, and you waste other people's 
resources.  Write a <I>really</I> bad network program, and you waste 
many thousands of people's resources at the same time.  Sloppy and 
malicious network programming forces network standards to be modified, 
made safer but less efficient. So be careful, respectful, and cooperative, 
for everyone's sake.

</P><P><B><I>In particular, don't be tempted to write programs that automatically
follow Web links</I></B> (called <I>robots</I> or <I>spiders</I>)
before you really know what you're doing.  They can be useful, but a 
badly-written robot is one of the worst kinds of programs on the Web,
blindly following a rapidly increasing number of links and quickly draining
server resources.  If you plan to write anything like a robot, please

    more about them</A>.
There may already be a working program to do what you want.  If you really

<A name="whatis"></A>
</P><H2>What is HTTP?</H2>

<P>HTTP stands for <B>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</B>.  It's the network
protocol used to deliver virtually all files and other data (collectively
called <I>resources</I>) on the World Wide Web, whether they're HTML files, 
image files, query results, or anything else.  Usually, HTTP takes place 
through TCP/IP sockets (and this tutorial ignores other possibilities).  

</P><P>A browser is an <I>HTTP client</I> because it sends requests to an 
<I>HTTP server</I> (Web server), which then sends responses back to 
the client.  The standard (and default) port for HTTP servers 
to listen on is 80, though they can use any port.

<A name="resources"></A>
</P><H3>What are "Resources"?</H3>

<P>HTTP is used to transmit <I>resources</I>, not just files.  A
resource is some chunk of information that can be identified by a URL
(it's the <B>R</B> in <B>URL</B>).  The most common kind of resource
is a file, but a resource may also be a dynamically-generated query
result, the output of a CGI script, a document that is available in 
several languages, or something else.

</P><P>While learning HTTP, it may help to think of a resource as similar to
a file, but more general.  As a practical matter, almost all HTTP resources 
are currently either files or server-side script output.

</P><P><A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>


</P><P></P><HR><P>

<A name="structure"></A>
</P><H2>Structure of HTTP Transactions</H2>

<P>Like most network protocols, HTTP uses the client-server model:
An <I>HTTP client</I> opens a connection and sends a <I>request message</I> 
to an <I>HTTP server</I>; the server then returns a <I>response message</I>,
usually containing the resource that was requested.  After delivering
the response, the server closes the connection (making HTTP a 
<I>stateless</I> protocol, i.e. not maintaining any connection information
between transactions).

</P><P>The format of the request and response messages are similar, and
English-oriented.  Both kinds of messages consist of: 
</P><UL>
<LI>an initial line, 
</LI><LI>zero or more header lines, 
</LI><LI>a blank line (i.e. a CRLF by itself), and 
</LI><LI>an optional message body (e.g. a file, or query data, or query output).  
</LI></UL>

<P>Put another way, the format of an HTTP message is:

</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;initial line, different for request vs. response&gt;
Header1: value1
Header2: value2
Header3: value3

&lt;optional message body goes here, like file contents or query data;
 it can be many lines long, or even binary data $&amp;*%@!^$@&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Initial lines and headers should end in CRLF, though you should
gracefully handle lines ending in just LF.  (More exactly, CR and LF
here mean ASCII values 13 and 10, even though some platforms may use
different characters.)

</P><P><A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>

<A name="requestline"></A>
</P><H3>Initial Request Line</H3>

<P>The initial line is different for the request than for the response.
A request line has three parts, separated by spaces: a <I>method</I> name, 
the local path of the requested resource, and the version of HTTP being used.
A typical request line is:

</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>GET /path/to/file/index.html HTTP/1.0
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Notes:
</P><UL>
<LI><B>GET</B> is the most common HTTP method; it says "give me this resource".  
    Other methods include <B>POST</B> and <B>HEAD</B>-- more on those 
    <A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#othermethods">later</A>.
    Method names are always uppercase.
</LI><LI>The path is the part of the URL after the host name, also called the
    <I>request URI</I> (a URI is like a URL, but more general).
</LI><LI>The HTTP version always takes the form "<B>HTTP/x.x</B>", 
    uppercase.
</LI></UL>

<P><A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>

<A name="responseline"></A>
</P><H3>Initial Response Line (Status Line)</H3>

<P>The initial response line, called the <I>status line</I>, also has 
three parts separated by spaces: the HTTP version, a
<I>response status code</I> that gives the result of the request, 
and an English <I>reason phrase</I> describing the status code.  
Typical status lines are:

</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>or

</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Notes:
</P><UL>
<LI>The HTTP version is in the same format as in the request line,
    "<B>HTTP/x.x</B>".
</LI><LI>The status code is meant to be computer-readable; the reason
    phrase is meant to be human-readable, and may vary.
</LI><LI>The status code is a three-digit integer, and the first digit identifies
    the general category of response:
    <UL>
    <LI><B>1xx</B> indicates an informational message only
    </LI><LI><B>2xx</B> indicates success of some kind
    </LI><LI><B>3xx</B> redirects the client to another URL
    </LI><LI><B>4xx</B> indicates an error on the client's part
    </LI><LI><B>5xx</B> indicates an error on the server's part
    </LI></UL>
</LI></UL>

The most common status codes are:
<DL>
<DT><B><TT>200 OK</TT></B>
</DT><DD>The request succeeded, and the resulting resource (e.g. file or script 
    output) is returned in the message body.
</DD><DT><B><TT>404 Not Found</TT></B>
</DT><DD>The requested resource doesn't exist.
</DD><DT><B><TT>301 Moved Permanently
    <BR>302 Moved Temporarily
    <BR>303 See Other</TT></B> <I>(HTTP&nbsp;1.1 only)</I>
</DT><DD>The resource has moved to another URL (given by the 
    <B><TT>Location:</TT></B> response header), and should be automatically 
    retrieved by the client.  This is often used by a CGI script to redirect 
    the browser to an existing file.
</DD><DT><B><TT>500 Server Error</TT></B>
</DT><DD>An unexpected server error.  The most common cause is a server-side 
    script that has bad syntax, fails, or otherwise can't run correctly.
</DD></DL>

<P>A complete list of status codes is in
<A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#httpspec">the HTTP specification</A>
(section 9 for HTTP&nbsp;1.0, and section 10 for HTTP&nbsp;1.1).


</P><P><A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>

<A name="headerlines"></A>
</P><H3>Header Lines</H3>

<P>Header lines provide information about the request or response, or 
about the object sent in the message body.

</P><P>The header lines are in the usual text header format, which is:  one line
per header, of the form "<B><TT>Header-Name:&nbsp;value</TT></B>", ending
with CRLF.  It's the same format used for email and news postings, defined in 
<A href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc822.html">RFC&nbsp;822</A>,
section 3.  Details about RFC&nbsp;822 header lines:
</P><UL>
<LI>As noted above, they should end in CRLF, but you should handle LF
    correctly.
</LI><LI>The header name is not case-sensitive (though the value may be).
</LI><LI>Any number of spaces or tabs may be between the ":" and the value.
</LI><LI>Header lines beginning with space or tab are actually part of the
    previous header line, folded into multiple lines for easy reading.
</LI></UL>

<P>Thus, the following two headers are equivalent:

</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Header1: some-long-value-1a, some-long-value-1b
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>HEADER1:    some-long-value-1a,
            some-long-value-1b
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HTTP&nbsp;1.0 defines 16 headers, though none are required. 
HTTP&nbsp;1.1 defines 46 headers, and one (<B><TT>Host:</TT></B>) is required in
requests.
For Net-politeness, consider including these headers in your requests:
</P><UL>
<LI>The <B><TT>From:</TT></B> header gives the email address of
    whoever's making the request, or running the program doing so.
    (This <I>must</I> be user-configurable, for privacy concerns.)
</LI><LI>The <B><TT>User-Agent:</TT></B> header identifies the program that's
    making the request, in the form "<B>Program-name/x.xx</B>", where 
    <B>x.xx</B> is the (mostly) alphanumeric version of the program.
    For example, Netscape 3.0 sends the header 
    "<B><TT>User-agent:&nbsp;Mozilla/3.0Gold</TT></B>".
</LI></UL>

<P>These headers help webmasters troubleshoot problems.  They also 
reveal information about the user.  When you decide which headers to 
include, you must balance the webmasters' logging needs against your users'
needs for privacy.

</P><P>If you're writing servers, consider including these headers in your 
responses:
</P><UL>
<LI>The <B><TT>Server:</TT></B> header is analogous to the 
    <B><TT>User-Agent:</TT></B> header:  it identifies the server software
    in the form "<B>Program-name/x.xx</B>".  For example, one beta version
    of <A href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache's</A> server returns 
    "<B><TT>Server:&nbsp;Apache/1.2b3-dev</TT></B>".
</LI><LI>The <B><TT>Last-Modified:</TT></B> header gives the modification date
    of the resource that's being returned.  It's used in caching and
    other bandwidth-saving activities.  Use Greenwich Mean Time, in the format
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>    Last-Modified: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT

<A name="messagebody"></A>
</P><H3>The Message Body</H3>

<P>An HTTP message may have a body of data sent after the header
lines.  In a response, this is where the requested resource is returned
to the client (the most common use of the message body), or perhaps
explanatory text if there's an error.  In a request, this is where
user-entered data or uploaded files are sent to the server.

</P><P>If an HTTP message includes a body, there are usually header lines in the
message that describe the body.  In particular, 
</P><UL>
<LI>The <B><TT>Content-Type:</TT></B> header gives the MIME-type of the data in
    the body, such as <B><TT>text/html</TT></B> or <B><TT>image/gif</TT></B>.
</LI><LI>The <B><TT>Content-Length:</TT></B> header gives the number of bytes

</P><H2>Other HTTP Methods, Like HEAD and POST</H2>

<P>Besides GET, the two most commonly used methods are HEAD and POST.


<A name="headmethod"></A>
</P><H3>The HEAD Method</H3>

<P>A HEAD request is just like a GET request, except it asks the server
to return the response headers only, and not the actual resource (i.e. no
message body).  This is useful to check characteristics of a resource 
without actually downloading it, thus saving bandwidth.  Use HEAD when 
you don't actually need a file's contents.

</P><P>The response to a HEAD request must <I>never</I> contain a message body,
just the status line and headers.

</P><P><A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>

<A name="postmethod"></A>
</P><H3>The POST Method</H3>

<P>A POST request is used to send data to the server to be processed
in some way, like by a CGI script.  A POST request is different from a 
GET request in the following ways:
</P><UL>
<LI>There's a block of data sent with the request, in the message body.
    There are usually extra headers to describe this message body, like
    <B><TT>Content-Type:</TT></B> and <B><TT>Content-Length:</TT></B>.
</LI><LI>The <I>request URI</I> is not a resource to retrieve; it's usually a 
    program to handle the data you're sending.
</LI><LI>The HTTP response is normally program output, not a static file.
</LI></UL>

<P>The most common use of POST, by far, is to submit HTML form data to CGI
scripts.  In this case, the <B><TT>Content-Type:</TT></B> header is usually
<B><TT>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</TT></B>, and the 
<B><TT>Content-Length:</TT></B> header gives the length of the URL-encoded 
form data (here's a
<A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/http_footnotes.html#urlencoding">note on URL-encoding</A>).  
The CGI script receives the message body through STDIN, and decodes it.
Here's a typical form submission, using POST:

<P>You can use a POST request to send whatever data you want, not just 
form submissions.  Just make sure the sender and the receiving program
agree on the format.

</P><P>The GET method can also be used to submit forms.  The form data is

<A name="proxies"></A>
</P><H2>HTTP Proxies</H2>

<P>An <I>HTTP proxy</I> is a program that acts as an intermediary between
a client and a server.  It receives requests from clients, and forwards 
those requests to the intended servers.  The responses pass back through it
in the same way.  Thus, a proxy has functions of both a client and a server.

</P><P>Proxies are commonly used in firewalls, for LAN-wide caches, or in other
situations.  If you're writing proxies, read the 
<A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#httpspec">HTTP specification</A>;
it contains details about proxies not covered in this tutorial.

</P><P>When a client uses a proxy, it typically sends all requests to 
that proxy, instead of to the servers in the URLs.  Requests to a proxy 
differ from normal requests in one way:  in the first line, they use the 
complete URL of the resource being requested, instead of just the path.  
For example,
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>GET http://www.somehost.com/path/file.html HTTP/1.0
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That way, the proxy knows which server to forward the request to (though
the proxy itself may use another proxy).

<!-- section 19.3 -->

<P>As the saying goes (in network programming, anyway), "Be strict in what

interact with may have minor flaws in their messages, but you should try to
work gracefully with them.  In particular, the

<P>That's the basic structure of HTTP.  If you understand everything so far,
you have a good overview of HTTP communication, and should be able to write 
simple HTTP&nbsp;1.0 programs.  See this
<A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/http_footnotes.html#sample">example</A> to get started.
Again, before you do anything heavy-duty, read 
<A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#httpspec">the specification</A>.

</P><P>The rest of this document tells how to upgrade your clients and servers 
to use HTTP&nbsp;1.1.  There is a list of new client requirements, and a 
list of new server requirements.  You can stop here if HTTP&nbsp;1.0
satisfies your current needs (though you'll probably need HTTP&nbsp;1.1 in 
the future).

</P><P><I>Note:  As of early 1997, the Web is moving from HTTP&nbsp;1.0 to 
HTTP&nbsp;1.1.  Whenever practical, use HTTP&nbsp;1.1.  It's more efficient 
overall, and by using it, you'll help the Web perform better for everyone.</I>

</P><H1>HTTP&nbsp;1.1</H1>

<P>Like many protocols, HTTP is constantly evolving.  HTTP&nbsp;1.1 has 
recently been defined, to address new needs and overcome shortcomings 
of HTTP&nbsp;1.0.  Generally speaking, it is a superset of HTTP&nbsp;1.0.
Improvements include:
</P><UL>
<LI>Faster response, by allowing multiple transactions to take place
    over a single <I>persistent connection</I>.
</LI><LI>Faster response and great bandwidth savings, by adding cache support.
</LI><LI>Faster response for dynamically-generated pages, by supporting
    <I>chunked encoding</I>, which allows a response to be sent before
    its total length is known.
</LI><LI>Efficient use of IP addresses, by allowing multiple domains to be 
    served from a single IP address.
</LI></UL>

<P>HTTP&nbsp;1.1 requires a few extra things from both clients and servers.
The next two sections detail how to make <A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#http1.1clients">clients</A> 
and <A href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#http1.1servers">servers</A> comply with HTTP&nbsp;1.1.  If 
you're only writing clients, you can skip the section on servers.  If you're 
writing servers, read both sections.

</P><P>Only <I>requirements</I> for HTTP&nbsp;1.1 compliance are described here.  
HTTP&nbsp;1.1 has many optional features you may find useful; read

</P><H3>Host: Header</H3>

<P>Starting with HTTP&nbsp;1.1, one server at one IP address can be 
<I>multi-homed</I>, i.e. the home of several Web domains.  For example, 
"www.host1.com" and "www.host2.com" can live on the same server.  

</P><P>Several domains living on the same server is like several people 
sharing one phone:  a caller knows who they're calling for, but whoever 
answers the phone doesn't.  Thus, every HTTP request must specify which 
host name (and possibly port) the request is intended for, with the 
<B><TT>Host:</TT></B> header.  A complete HTTP&nbsp;1.1 request might be
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>GET /path/file.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.host1.com:80
[blank line here]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

except the "<TT>:80</TT>" isn't required, since that's the default HTTP port.

<P><B><TT>Host:</TT></B> is the only required header in an HTTP&nbsp;1.1 request.
<I>It's also the most urgently needed new feature in HTTP&nbsp;1.1.</I>  Without it,
each host name requires a unique IP address, and we're
quickly running out of IP addresses with the explosion of new domains.

<A name="http1.1c2"></A>
</P><H3>Chunked Transfer-Encoding</H3>

<P>If a server wants to start sending a response before knowing its total
length (like with long script output), it might use the simple
<I>chunked transfer-encoding</I>, which breaks the complete response into
smaller chunks and sends them in series.  You can identify such a response 
because it contains the "<B><TT>Transfer-Encoding:&nbsp;chunked</TT></B>" header.
All HTTP&nbsp;1.1 clients must be able to receive chunked messages.

</P><P>A chunked message body contains a series of <I>chunks</I>, followed by a 
line with "0" (zero), followed by optional footers (just like headers), and a 
blank line.  Each chunk consists of two parts: 
</P><UL>
<LI>a line with the size of the chunk data, in hex, possibly followed
    by a semicolon and extra parameters you can ignore (none are currently
    standard), and ending with CRLF.
</LI><LI>the data itself, followed by CRLF.
</LI></UL>

<P>So a chunked response might look like the following:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
10
1234567890abcdef
0
some-footer: some-value
another-footer: another-value
[blank line here]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note the blank line after the last footer.  The length of the
text data is 42 bytes (1a&nbsp;+&nbsp;10, in hex), and the data itself is
<B>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdef</B>.  The footers should be
treated like headers, as if they were at the top of the response.

</P><P>The chunks can contain any binary data, and may be much larger than the 
examples here.  The size-line parameters are rarely used, but you 
should at least ignore them correctly.  Footers are also rare, but might
be appropriate for things like checksums or digital signatures.

</P><P>For comparison, here's the equivalent to the above response, without 
using chunked encoding:

</P><H3>Persistent Connections and the "Connection:&nbsp;close" Header</H3>
<!-- sections 8.1, 14.10 -->

<P>In HTTP&nbsp;1.0 and before, TCP connections are closed after each request 
and response, so each resource to be retrieved requires its own connection.  
Opening and closing TCP connections takes a substantial amount of CPU time, 
bandwidth, and memory.  In practice, most Web pages consist of several 
files on the same server, so much can be saved by allowing several requests 
and responses to be sent through a single <I>persistent connection</I>.

</P><P>Persistent connections are the default in HTTP&nbsp;1.1, so nothing special
is required to use them.  Just open a connection and send several requests 
in series (called <I>pipelining</I>), and read the responses in the same 
order as the requests were sent.  If you do this, be very careful to read 
the correct length of each response, to separate them correctly.

</P><P>If a client includes the "<B><TT>Connection:&nbsp;close</TT></B>" header 
in the request, then the connection will be closed after the corresponding 
response.  <B>Use this if you don't support persistent connections</B>, 
or if you know a request will be the last on its connection.  Similarly, 
if a response contains this header, then the server will close the 
connection following that response, and the client shouldn't send any 
more requests through that connection.

</P><P>A server might close the connection before all responses are sent, so
a client must keep track of requests and resend them as needed.  When 
resending, don't pipeline the requests until you know the connection is 
persistent.  Don't pipeline at all if you know the server won't support 
persistent connections (like if it uses HTTP&nbsp;1.0, based on a previous 
response).

</P><H3>The "100&nbsp;Continue" Response</H3>

<P>During the course of an HTTP&nbsp;1.1 client sending a request to a server,
the server might respond with an interim "<B><TT>100&nbsp;Continue</TT></B>"
response.  This means the server has received the first part of the request,
and can be used to aid communication over slow links.  In any case, all
HTTP&nbsp;1.1 clients must handle the 100 response correctly (perhaps 
by just ignoring it).

</P><P>The "<B><TT>100&nbsp;Continue</TT></B>" response is structured like 
any HTTP response, i.e. consists of a status line, optional headers, 
and a blank line.  Unlike other responses, it is always followed by 
another complete, final response.

</P><P>So, further extending the last example, the full data that comes
back from the server might consist of two responses in series, like

</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT

some-footer: some-value
another-footer: another-value

abcdefghijklmnoprstuvwxyz1234567890abcdef

<P>To handle this, a simple HTTP&nbsp;1.1 client might read one response from the 
socket; if the status code is 100, discard the first response and read the 
next one instead.

<P>This requirement applies <I>only</I> to clients using HTTP&nbsp;1.1, not

the server should send responses back in the same order as the requests--
this is all it takes for a server to support persistent connections.

</P><P>If a request includes the "<B><TT>Connection:&nbsp;close</TT></B>" header, 
that request is the final one for the connection and the server should 
close the connection after sending the response.  Also, the server should
close an idle connection after some timeout period (can be anything;
10 seconds is fine).

</P><P>If you don't want to support persistent connections, include the 
"<B><TT>Connection:&nbsp;close</TT></B>" header in the response.  Use this 
header whenever you want to close the connection, even if not all requests 
have been fulfilled.  The header says that the connection will be closed

correctly.

    Headers</H3>
<!-- sections 14.24 and 14.28 -->
    
<P>To avoid sending resources that don't need to be sent, thus saving 
bandwidth, HTTP&nbsp;1.1 defines the <B><TT>If-Modified-Since:</TT></B><TT></TT> and 
<B><TT>If-Unmodified-Since:</TT></B><TT></TT> request headers.  
The former says "only send the resource if it has changed since this date"; 
the latter says the opposite.  Clients aren't required to use them, but 
HTTP&nbsp;1.1 servers are required to honor requests that do use them.

</P><P>Unfortunately, due to earlier HTTP versions, 
the date value may be in any of three possible formats:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>If-Modified-Since:  Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Again, all time values in HTTP use Greenwich Mean Time (though try to be 
tolerant of non-GMT times).  If a date with a two-digit year seems to be more
than 50 years in the future, treat it as being in the past-- this
helps with the millennium bug.  In fact, do this with any date handling in
HTTP&nbsp;1.1.

</P><P><I>Although servers must accept all three date formats, HTTP&nbsp;1.1 
clients and servers must only generate the first kind.</I>

</P><P>If the date in either of these headers is invalid, or is in the future, 
ignore the header.

</P><P>If, without the header, the request would result in an unsuccessful
(non-200-level) status code, ignore the header and send the non-200-level 
response.  In other words, only apply these headers when you know the 
resource would otherwise be sent.

</P><P>The <B><TT>If-Modified-Since:</TT></B><TT></TT> header is used with a GET
request.  If the requested resource has been modified since the given date, 
ignore the header and return the resource as you normally would.

POST method too.  

</P><P>Four other methods (PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE) are defined in 
HTTP&nbsp;1.1, but are rarely used.  If a client requests a method you don't
support, respond with "<B><TT>501&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Implemented</TT></B>", like

</P><H3>Supporting HTTP&nbsp;1.0 Requests</H3>

<P>To be compatible with older browsers, HTTP&nbsp;1.1 servers must support
HTTP&nbsp;1.0 requests.  In particular, when a request uses HTTP&nbsp;1.0 
(as identified in the initial request line),
</P><UL>
<LI>don't require the <B><TT>Host:</TT></B><TT></TT> header, and
</LI><LI>don't send the "<B><TT>100&nbsp;Continue</TT></B>" response.

</P><H1>The HTTP Specification</H1>

<P>If you plan to do anything elaborate in HTTP, read the
official specification.  HTTP&nbsp;1.0 was never made an official 
Internet standard, but the <I>de facto</I> standard is described in 
<A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc1945.html">RFC&nbsp;1945</A>.
HTTP&nbsp;1.1 was developed by a 
<A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/">working group</A> of the 
<A href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</A>, openly gathering input from many 
sources before reaching an approximate consensus.  The resulting specification
is <A href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">RFC 2616</A>,
released in June 1999.
