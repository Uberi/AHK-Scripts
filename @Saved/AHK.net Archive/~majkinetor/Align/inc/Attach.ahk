/*
	Function:		Attach
					Determines how a control is resized with its parent.

	hCtrl:			
					- hWnd of the control if aDef is not empty.					
					- hWnd of the parent to be reset if aDef is empty. If you are using the function with only one parent, you don't have to
					specify its handle, its enough to call Attach without any parameters.
					With multiple parents you need to specify which one you want to reset.					
					- Handler name, if parameter is string and aDef is empty. Handler will be called after the function has finished 
					moving controls for the parent. Handler receives hWnd of the parent as its only argument.

	aDef:			
					Attach definition string. Space separated list of attach options. If omitted, function working depends on hCtrl parameter.
					
					- 	You can use x,y,w,h,r,p letters along with coefficients, decimal numbers which can also
						be specified in m/n form (see example below). "r" or "r1" option specifies that control should be redrawn immediately.
						Specify "r2" to delay redrawing 100ms for the control. This can be used to prevent redrawing spam which in some situations
						may be annoying. 
					-	"p" is special coeficient that can only be used without x-h options and it must be first option. 
						It means "proportional". It will make control always stay in the same proportion to its parent 
						(so, pin the control to the parent). Although you can mix pinned and non-pinned controls 
						that is rarely what you want. You will generally want to pin every control in the parent.				
					-	You can use single letters "+" or "-" to enable or disable function for the control. If control is hidden, you may want to 
						disable the function for performance reasons. Its perfectly OK to leave invisible controls attached, but if you have lots of 
						them you can use this feature to get faster and more responsive updates.
						When you want to show disabled invisible control, make sure you first attach it back so it can take its correct position
						and size while in hidden state, then show it.													

	Remarks:
					You should reset the function when you programmatically change the position of the controls in the parent control.
					Don't do this while parent is resizing as resetting procedure may be interrupted (this is also true for "+" & "-" options).
					Depending on how you created your GUI, you might need to put "autosize" when showing it, otherwise reseting the Gui before its 
					placement is changed will not work as intented. Autosize will make sure that WM_SIZE handler fires. Sometimes, however, WM_SIZE
					message isn't sent to the window. One example is for instance when some control requires Gui size to be set in advance in which case
					you would first have "Gui, Show, w100 h100 Hide" line prior to adding controls, and only Gui, Show after controls are added. This
					case will not trigger WM_SIZE message unless AutoSize is added.
					
					Function monitors WM_SIZE message to detect parent changes. That means that it can be used with other eventual container controls
					and not only top level windows.
				
	Examples:
	(start code)
					Attach(h, "w.5 h1/3 r2")	;Attach control's w, h and redraw it with delay.
					Attach(h, "-")				;Disable function for control h but keep its definition. To enable it latter use "+".
					Attach()					;Reset first parent. Use when you have only 1 parent.
					Attach(hGui2)				;Reset Gui2.
					Attach("Win_Redraw")		;Use Win_Redraw function as a Handler. Attach will call it with parent's handle as argument.
					Attach(h, "p r2")			;Pin control with delayed refreshing.

					
					; This is how to do delayed refresh of entire window.
					; To prevent redraw spam which can be annoying in some cases, 
					; you can choose to redraw entire window only when user has finished resizing it.
					; This is similar to r2 option for controls, except it works with entire parent.
					
					Attach("OnAttach")			;Set Handler to OnAttach function
					...
					
					OnAttach( Hwnd ) {
						global hGuiToRedraw := hwnd
						SetTimer, Redraw, -100
					}

					Redraw:
						Win_Redraw(hGuiToRedraw)
					return
