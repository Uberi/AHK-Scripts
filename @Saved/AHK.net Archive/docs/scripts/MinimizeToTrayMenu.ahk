; Minimize Window to Tray Menu
; http://www.autohotkey.com
; This script assigns a hotkey of your choice to hide any window so that
; it becomes an entry at the bottom of the script's tray menu.  Hidden
; windows can then be unhidden individually or all at once by selecting
; the corresponding item on the menu.  If the script exits for any reason,
; all the windows that it hid will be unhidden automatically.

; CHANGES:
; July 22, 2005 (changes provided by egilmour):
; - Added new hotkey to unhide the last hidden window (Win+U)
;
; November 3, 2004 (changes provided by trogdor):
; - Program manager is prevented from being hidden.
; - If there is no active window, the minimize-to-tray hotkey will have
;   no effect rather than waiting indefinitely.
;
; October 23, 2004:
; - The taskbar is prevented from being hidden.
; - Some possible problems with long window titles have been fixed.
; - Windows without a title can be hidden without causing problems.
; - If the script is running under AHK v1.0.22 or greater, the
;   maximum length of each menu item is increased from 100 to 260.

; CONFIGURATION SECTION: Change the below values as desired.

; This is the maximum number of windows to allow to be hidden (having a
; limit helps performance):
mwt_MaxWindows = 50

; This is the hotkey used to hide the active window:
mwt_Hotkey = #h  ; Win+H

; This is the hotkey used to unhide the last hidden window:
mwt_UnHotkey = #u  ; Win+U

; If you prefer to have the tray menu empty of all the standard items,
; such as Help and Pause, use N.  Otherwise, use Y:
mwt_StandardMenu = N

; These next few performance settings help to keep the action within the
; #HotkeyModifierTimeout period, and thus avoid the need to release and
; press down the hotkey's modifier if you want to hide more than one
; window in a row.  These settings are not needed you choose to have the
; script use the keyboard hook via #InstallKeybdHook or other means:
#HotkeyModifierTimeout 100
SetWinDelay 10
SetKeyDelay 0

#SingleInstance  ; Allow only one instance of this script to be running.

; END OF CONFIGURATION SECTION (do not make changes below this point
; unless you want to change the basic functionality of the script).

; Because hiding the window won't deactivate it, activate the window
; beneath this one (if any). I tried other ways, but they wound up
; activating the task bar.  This way sends the active window (which is
; about to be hidden) to the back of the stack, which seems best:
Send, !{esc}
; Hide it only now that WinGetTitle/WinGetClass above have been run (since
; by default, those commands cannot detect hidden windows):
WinHide

; If the title is blank, use the class instead.  This serves two purposes:
; 1) A more meaningful name is used as the menu name.
; 2) Allows the menu item to be created (otherwise, blank items wouldn't
;    be handled correctly by the various routines below).
