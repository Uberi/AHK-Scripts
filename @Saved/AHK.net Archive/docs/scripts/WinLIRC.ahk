; WinLIRC Client
; http://www.autohotkey.com
; This script receives notifications from WinLIRC whenever you press
; a button on your remote control. It can be used to automate Winamp,
; Windows Media Player, etc. It's easy to configure. For example, if
; WinLIRC recognizes a button named "VolUp" on your remote control,
; create a label named VolUp and beneath it use the command
; "SoundSet +5" to increase the soundcard's volume by 5%.

; Here are the steps to use this script:
; 1) Configure WinLIRC to recognize your remote control and its buttons.
;    WinLIRC is at http://winlirc.sourceforge.net
; 2) Edit the WinLIRC path, address, and port in the CONFIG section below.
; 3) Launch this script. It will start the WinLIRC server if needed.
; 4) Press some buttons on your remote control. A small window will
;    appear showing the name of each button as you press it.
; 5) Configure your buttons to send keystrokes and mouse clicks to
;    windows such as Winamp, Media Player, etc. See the examples below.

; This script requires AutoHotkey 1.0.38.04 or later.
; HISTORY OF CHANGES
; March 2, 2007:
; - Improved reliability via "Critical" in ReceiveData().
; October 5, 2005:
; - Eliminated Winsock warning dialog "10054" upon system shutdown/logoff.
; - Added option "DelayBetweenButtonRepeats" to throttle the repeat speed.

; -------------------------------------------------
; CONFIGURATION SECTION: Set your preferences here.
; -------------------------------------------------
; Some remote controls repeat the signal rapidly while you're holding down
; a button. This makes it difficult to get the remote to send only a single
; signal. The following setting solves this by ignoring repeated signals
; until the specified time has passed. 200 is often a good setting.  Set it
; to 0 to disable this feature.
DelayBetweenButtonRepeats = 200

; Specify the path to WinLIRC, such as C:\WinLIRC\winlirc.exe
WinLIRC_Path = %A_ProgramFiles%\WinLIRC\winlirc.exe

; Specify WinLIRC's address and port. The most common are 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and 8765.
WinLIRC_Address = 127.0.0.1
WinLIRC_Port = 8765

; Do not change the following two lines. Skip them and continue below.

; --------------------------------------------
; ASSIGN ACTIONS TO THE BUTTONS ON YOUR REMOTE
; --------------------------------------------
; Configure your remote control's buttons below. Use WinLIRC's names
; for the buttons, which can be seen in your WinLIRC config file
; (.cf file) -- or you can press any button on your remote and the
; script will briefly display the button's name in a small window.
; 
; Below are some examples. Feel free to revise or delete them to suit
; your preferences.

VolUp:
SoundSet +5  ; Increase master volume by 5%. On Vista, replace this line with: Send {Volume_Up}
return

VolDown:
SoundSet -5  ; Reduce master volume by 5%. On Vista, replace this line with: Send {Volume_Down}

	Send {WheelUp}  ; Rotate the mouse wheel up by one notch.
