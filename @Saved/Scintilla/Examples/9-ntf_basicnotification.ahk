    ---------------------
    In this example we will catch the scintilla notifications.
    For that we just have to set the variable sciObj.notify with the name of a custom function which will be called
    whenever a scintilla message is sent.

    There are some variables in the main object that are set by different messages. Please read the code for information on this.
