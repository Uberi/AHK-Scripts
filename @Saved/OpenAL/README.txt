The alut.dll can be downloaded from http://www.openal.org. It will need to
be included in any project that uses the alut functions. It does not install
with the regular OpenAL library.

The OpenAL library itself can also be downloaded from http://www.openal.org.
It will need to be installed before this demo will work.

Finally, the accompaning dust.wav is a sample of a converted midi file. I wish
I could remember where I obtained it or who the author was so I could give them
credit.
