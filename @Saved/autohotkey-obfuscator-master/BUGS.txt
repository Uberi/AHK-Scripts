3/23/2013 - If a function or label section is commented out by putting a /* before it and a */ after it then the program will not obfuscate correctly if the obfuscator scramble order function is used. these types of comments between functions and labels or within functions and labels will not cause a problem, it is only when you comment out an entire function or label section this way that causes a problem.
